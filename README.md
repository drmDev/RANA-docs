# RANA – Really Awesome Navigation App

🚗 **Simple, Efficient Route Planning — 100% Free to Use**

---

## Why RANA?

Most route optimization apps are built for enterprise use and come with **hefty monthly subscription fees**. But what if you just need a smart, simple way to plan errands, deliveries, or travel — with no commitment?

**RANA is designed for everyday users**:
- 🧠 Smart, lightweight algorithms that skip bloated server costs  
- 🗺️ Seamlessly hands off your route to **Apple Maps for final navigation**
- 🔒 No tracking, no data harvesting — ever

## 🚫 Not iOS Maps — Here’s the Difference

RANA is *not* a replacement for Apple Maps — it enhances it.

**iOS Maps** allows users to manually enter destinations and then navigates them in the order entered.

**RANA**, on the other hand:
- ✅ Optimizes multiple stops to **find the most efficient route**
- ✅ Accepts **lists of destinations**, then intelligently reorders them
- ✅ Sends the **optimized result** to iOS Maps for actual GPS navigation

This makes it ideal for:
- Running errands
- Making deliveries
- Planning complex road trips

To avoid confusion, RANA only triggers navigation **after** optimization.

## Free Version Limits

RANA is **completely free to use**, with generous limits designed for regular users:

- ✅ **12 optimizations per month** *(resets on the 1st of each month)*  
- ✅ **Up to 20 destinations per route**

If enough users find value in RANA, I may offer an optional paid version in the future with expanded limits — but there is **no paid version available at this time**.
