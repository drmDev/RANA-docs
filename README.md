# RANA – Really Awesome Navigation App

🚗 **Efficient Route Planning with a One-Time Purchase – No Subscriptions. Ever.**

## Why RANA?

Most route optimization apps today are built for enterprise users and come with **hefty monthly subscription fees**. But what if you just need a simple, smart way to plan routes for deliveries, errands, or travel – without a recurring cost?

**RANA was built with everyday users in mind**:
- 🧠 Smart, lightweight algorithms that avoid bloated server costs  
- 🗺️ Seamlessly integrated with Apple Maps  
- 🔒 No tracking, no data harvesting – ever

## Free Version Features

RANA is free to try, with generous usage to help you evaluate the full app experience:

- ✅ **12 optimizations per month**  
- ✅ **Up to 20 destinations per route**  

This is more than enough to experience how RANA improves your planning — and gives you a clear sense of the value provided in the full version. If there is substantial interest, I will put more time into the full (one-time payment) version to allow unlocking unlimited monthly usage.

## Platform Support

- ✅ **iOS only** – developed in **Swift** using **Xcode**  
- 🧭 Built on **Apple’s MapKit**, which allows free, integrated navigation  
- ⛔ Android is not currently supported due to the lack of a comparable free navigation stack

## Development Notes

RANA is written entirely in **Swift** and developed with **Xcode**.  
This public repository contains support and legal information.  
The full source code is private, as the app is a commercial product.

## Visual Assets

Icons and banner artwork were generated using **OpenAI’s GPT-4o image generation**.  
🐸 *No frogs were harmed in the making of this app.*
