# RANA – Really Awesome Navigation App

🚗 **Efficient Route Planning with a One-Time Purchase – No Subscriptions. Ever.**

## Why RANA?

Most route optimization apps today are built for enterprise users and come with **hefty monthly subscription fees**. But what if you just need a simple, smart way to plan routes for deliveries, errands, or travel – without a recurring cost?

**RANA was built with everyday users in mind**:  
- 🏷️ **One-time purchase** – just $4.99 (less than your morning coffee ☕)  
- 🧠 Smart, lightweight algorithms that avoid bloated server costs  
- 🗺️ Seamlessly integrated with Apple Maps  
- 🔒 No tracking, no data harvesting – ever

## Free Version Features

RANA is free to try, with generous usage to help you evaluate the full app experience:

- ✅ **2 optimizations per day**  
- ✅ **10 optimizations per month**  
- ✅ **Up to 20 destinations per route**  

This is more than enough to experience how RANA improves your planning — and gives you a clear sense of the value provided in the full version.

## How It Works

RANA uses an efficient hybrid algorithm to optimize your route quickly and cost-effectively:

- 📍 **Nearest Neighbor** – builds a fast initial route  
- ♻️ **2-opt Optimization** – refines the path for better efficiency  
- 🧭 **MapKit + Directions API** – powers real-world turn-by-turn navigation  
- 🔁 **Fallbacks and Smart Defaults** – minimize delays and avoid 3rd-party fees

By skipping costly APIs (like Google's) and using optimized logic, RANA keeps performance high and costs low.

## Platform Support

- ✅ **iOS only** – developed in **Swift** using **Xcode**  
- 🧭 Built on **Apple’s MapKit**, which allows free, integrated navigation  
- ⛔ Android is not currently supported due to the lack of a comparable free navigation stack

## Development Notes

RANA is written entirely in **Swift** and developed with **Xcode**.  
This public repository contains support and legal information.  
The full source code is private, as the app is a commercial product.
